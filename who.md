Benedito de Espinosa, Portuguese: [bɨnɨˈðitu ðɨ ʃpiˈnɔzɐ]; 24 November **1632**
– 21 February **1677**, later Benedict de Spinoza) was a **Jewish-Dutch philosopher**
of Portuguese Sephardi origin. By laying the groundwork for
the Enlightenment and modern biblical criticism, including modern
conceptions of the self and the universe, he came to be considered one
of the great **rationalists** of 17th-century philosophy. Along with René
Descartes, Spinoza was a leading philosophical figure of the Dutch Golden
Age. Spinoza's given name, which means 'Blessed', varies among different
languages. In Hebrew, it is written ברוך שפינוזה‬. His Portuguese name is
Benedito 'Bento' de Espinosa or d'Espinosa. In his Latin works, he used
Latin: Benedictus de Spinoza.
